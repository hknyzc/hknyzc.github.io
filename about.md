<p>I was born in 1994 in Ankara. I completed my primary and secondary education in Ankara. In 2008, I took the Military High Schools Entrance Exam, apart from the high school entrance exams. I was entitled to study for the Air, Navy and Land Forces and with the desire to become a Combat Pilot, one of my childhood dreams, I started Bursa Işıklar Military Air High School. I finished my five-year high school education with the English preparatory class and entered the Air Force Academy in 2013. Like every student at the Air Force Academy, I needed to get a minor education, and I took my chance on Computer Engineering, another one of my childhood dreams. In 2016, after all military students were dismissed from their schools, I transferred to Izmir Institute of Technology. I graduated from this school in 2020 as a Computer Engineer. After graduating, I worked briefly as a backend and API developer. Afterwards, I continued my career as an Application Security Engineer. I am currently working as a Business Development Manager and Application Security/DevSecOps Engineer in a cyber security consulting company.</p>

<p>Apart from my academic life, I dealt with Taekwondo and played the guitar during my secondary school years. In high school, I first took part in the school's athletics team and then became interested in photography and the art of marbling. In the Military Academy, I worked in the school's Horn-Trempet Team and later in the cinema club.</p>

<p>Currently, I play the flute as an amateur as a hobby and I am a licensed drone pilot.</p>
